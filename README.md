Logan Dick

My name is Logan Dick, and I am a student learning how to use Git and GitHub. The most valuable aspect of using Git is version control, which allows me to track changes, revert mistakes, and keep a history of my work. GitHub adds value by providing a remote backup of my files and making it easy to share and manage repositories online. GitHub Desktop is especially useful because it offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies committing, branching, and syncing changes without needing to rely heavily on command-line tools. Overall, Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop are powerful tools that help improve organization, reliability, and efficiency when working on code and engineering projects.
